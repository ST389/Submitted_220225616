## Project Title

Hybrid NLP and Time-Series Model for S&P 500 Forecasting Using News Headlines

Overview

This project explores the integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and time-series forecasting for predicting short-term movements of the S&P 500 index.

The pipeline combines sentiment analysis of financial news headlines using transformer-based models (RoBERTa and BERT) with historical OHLCV stock data modeled via Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.

The core hypothesis: financial news sentiment provides predictive signals that improve forecasting performance compared to numerical stock data alone.
